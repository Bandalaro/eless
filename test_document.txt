ELESS Test Document

This is a test document for the ELESS (Evolving Low-resource Embedding and Storage System) pipeline.

Introduction
ELESS is designed to be a resilient RAG data processing pipeline that can handle document parsing, text chunking, embedding generation, and vector database storage with comprehensive logging and error handling.

Features
1. Multi-database support - ChromaDB, Qdrant, FAISS, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra
2. Comprehensive logging with file output and log rotation
3. CLI interface with database selection options
4. Resumable processing with checkpoint support
5. Performance monitoring and error tracking

Testing Instructions
This document should be processed by the ELESS pipeline to:
- Extract and chunk the text content
- Generate vector embeddings using a sentence transformer model
- Store the vectors in the selected vector databases
- Log all operations with appropriate detail levels

The system should create multiple text chunks from this document, each with associated metadata including file hash, chunk index, and processing timestamps.

Conclusion
If you can read this in your vector database, the ELESS pipeline is working correctly!
